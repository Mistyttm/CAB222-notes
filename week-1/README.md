## Internet History

### Why do we need to know the history of the Internet?
 - We need to know the past to understand the present, in turn to do better in the future.

### Network Control Protocol (NCP)
 - 1st packet-switching protocol on ARPANET
	 - standardised ARPANET
 - Allowed users access to use remote computers
 - Provided middle layer of protocol stack
	 - enabled Email and File transfer
 - Robert Kahn and Vinton Cert built on NCP to make TCP/IP

### Interface Message Processor (IMP)
 - packet switching node
	 - used to allow participating networks to connect to ARPANET
	 - Late 1960s-1989
 - 1st generation of gateways
	 - known as routers
 - 1st standardisation documents\
	 - IETF
 - Honeywell DDP-516 microcomputer with special-purpose interfaces and software
 - RFC1
	 - used protocols eventually adopted by internet routers

### Internet History
 - In response to USSR satellite
 - US formed ARPA
	 - within Department of Defence
 - ARPANET commissioned by DoD in 1969
 - 15 nodes (23 hosts) in 1971
 - TCP designed in 1974
 - TCP/IP established as the protocol route for ARPANET 1982
 - External Gateway Protocol (RFC 827) specification written 1982
 - internet transitions from NCP to TCP/IP in 1983
 - WWW released in 1991
 - first remotely operated machine hooked up in 1990
 - us whitehouse came online [www.whitehouse.gov](www.whitehouse.gov) in 1993
 - pizza hut online ordering in 1994

## Basic Network Communications

### LANs, WANs, MANs and Internetworks
 - Local Area Networks (LAN)
	 - network in a limited geographic area
 - Wide Area Networks (WANs)
	 - third party services to carry communications between networks
 - Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs)
	 - use WANs to interconnect LANs in a specific geographic region
 - Internetwork
	 - networked collection of LANs
	 - tied together with devices like routers

### Internet, Intranet and Extranet

## Network Architecture
